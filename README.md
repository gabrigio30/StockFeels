# StockFeels
StockFeels is a tool built to get a taste of stocks' latest news without having to open an insane amount of financial articles daily and maybe even make decisions on an investment you've been thinking about lately. It utilizes sentiment analysis to filter the news and give you an idea of what the mood is today for that stock.
